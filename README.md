# ðŸ›’ Webshop

Webshop is a website where you can buy some products, in the home page the site will show you the well-rated products and you can see all the products of the Webshop if you want to.

# ðŸ’¡ Currently all the site does is:
<ol>
  <li>Show the well-rated products of the API</li>
  <li>Show all the products of the API</li>
  <li>Show a log in form to the user</li>
</ol>

# ðŸš€ Plans for the future: 
- Show the products with the lowest prices
- Make the Create New Account page for new users
- Make a page to display the product the user wants to buy
- Style the LogIn page and the new pages that I will be making
